Description

The candidate cis-regulatory element (CRE) was defined as the 200bp centered statistical fine-mapping SNP (PIP > 0.5) and associated with the enhancer activity in liver tissue.

For each candidate CRE, three gRNAs were designed in a 200bp region centered on the statistical fine-mapping SNP.

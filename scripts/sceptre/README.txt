To detect target genes of the candidate CRE, we use SCEPTRE https://timothy-barry.github.io/sceptre-book/

The basic idea is to compare whether cells in the treatment group (cells containing gRNA targeting the candidate gene in cis) have significantly different expression of the candidate gene compared to the control group (cells do not contain gRNA targeting the candidate gene).
